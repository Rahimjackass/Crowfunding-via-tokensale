# Crowdsale
Crowdfunding by offering company's share as a token.
Here are couple of scripts written in solidity in order to execute a crowdfunding via tokensale.
They are working via importing and exporting data from each other.
Purpose of the whole project is to firstly give permission to a specific user wallet address (public key) for buying tokens,then he can exchanges his ethers with our token.
